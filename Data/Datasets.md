# Datasets

### **2021 U.S. Climate Events**
**Description:** This data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. It provides data on storm event details including: date, location, type, injuries, deaths, damages ($), brief discriptions of event, and more. I can use this data to find the storm events of most significance/serious impacts.

### **COVID-19 Cases and Deaths January 2020 - January 2022**
**Description:** These two datasets detail COVID-19 death and confirmed cases by county for each state. I can use this data to compare the death and confirmed cases of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. I can then compare these with respective net-incomes, COVID-19 related policies, and population densities. The purpose would be to explore possible relationships between confirmed cases/deaths and enforced (or absent) COVID-19 policies, population densities, and level of income.
