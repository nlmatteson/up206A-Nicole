# **Welcome! This is Nicole's Repository for UP206A: *Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science***

## **About Nicole**
I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. Growing up, I enjoyed going to the beach, road trips, and spending time with pets. I was a dancer for 18 years, mostly contemporary, jazz, and I competed in hip hop for four years. I went to UC Santa Cruz for undergrad where I studied environmental studies and minored in sustainability. The environment has always been a large passion of mine, and the fear of climate change is my main motivator. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life until my senior year when I took a *Green Cities* class with Dr. Adam Millard-Ball. His class inspired me to pursue a career adapting to and mitagting climate change through urban planning. I became facinated with innovative adaptation and mitigation strategies which accomplished multiple goals simultaneously. My senior thesis on Harvesting Wave Energy for Renewable Energy Production, Coastal Protection, and Desalination recieved the Senior Comprehensive Award from the Environmental Studies department and was one of my all time favorite projects. 

After graduation in June 2020, I underwent two major hip surgeries (the costs of being a retired dancer) which left me legally handicapped for six months. Losing the ability to walk, tie my shoes, and have mobile independence opened my eyes to how the world is designed for fully functioning people. This experience motived me to prioritize the differently abled in urban planning, especially transportation. After I was able to be a functioning human, I worked with the County of San Diego as a Land-use Aide where I processed building permits for various residential projects. 

My concentration within the MURP department is a combination of Transportation Policy and Planning & Environmental Analysis and Policy. My research interests include equitable climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, regenerative urban environments, transit oriented development, community informed planning, and political ecology.

## About UP 206A
It is my understanding that this course is meant to introduce students to the foundations of spatial data science and will teach the technical skills needed for Geographic Information Systems and Data Science analysis. Students will also be taught how to code with Python and how to use coding for spatial data research and analysis. Project within the course will be *applied*, meaning lessons and data will be based on relavent and contemporary urban phenomena. 

## Nicole's Course Objectives
After taking this course, I hope to know how to
1. Visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
2. Produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
3. Have confidence in coding and data analysis

## Possible research ideas include...
- Socio-economic impacts of sea level rise in San Diego, CA
- Extreme heat impacts in Los Angeles, CA
- Socio-economic impacts of 2021 natural disasters
- Comparing COVID-19 cases and deaths between California, New York, Florida, and Texas
- and more!
